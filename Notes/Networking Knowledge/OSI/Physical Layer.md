It is the lowest layer of the OSI model and is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices. It contains information in form of bits.

It's functions are:

- ***Bit Synchronization*** - provides the synchronization of the bits by providing a clock. This clock controls both sender and receiver thus providing synchronization at the bit level.

- ***Bit rate control***  - defines the transmission rate i.e. the number of bits sent per second.

- ***Physical [Topologies](Network%20Topologies.md)*** - specifies how the different, devices/nodes are arranged in a network

- ***Transmission Mode*** - defines how the data flows between the two connected devices.
