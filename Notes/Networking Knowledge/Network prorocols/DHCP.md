When a device connects to a network, a handshake takes place. In this process, the device and DHCP server communicate using the following steps:

1. The device connects and sends a DHCP broadcast request to the LAN to find a  DHCP server that can assign an [[IP]] address to it.

2. One or more DHCP servers responds and offers available addresses.

3. The device selects the address and then requests it.

4. If the server approves the request it acknowledges it and records the devices IP address , MAC address and other details such as host name and [[Subnet Mask]].

5. The device has the selected IP address for some amount of time and after that it is assigned a new one.
