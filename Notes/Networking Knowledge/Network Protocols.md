## ***[[Application Layer]]***

- [[DNS]] - (Domain Name System) a protocol that acts as Internets phone directory.

- [[DHCP]] - (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) automatically assigns IP addresses to other devices on the network.

- [[FTP]] -  (File Transfer Protocol)is a protocol that transfers files between a client and server and operates over TCP/IP.

- [[HTTP]] - (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) works on [client server model](obsidian://open?vault=CyberSecurityNotes&file=CyberSecurity%2FNotes%2FFundamental%20IT%20Skills%2FBasics%20of%20Computer%20Networking%2FNet-Architecture%2FClient-Server%20Architecture) as a primary way f communication between browsers a and servers  to share information over the internet.

- [[SMTP]] - (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) - the most used email protocol controls how email clients send users email messages

- [[SNMP]] -  (Simple Network Management Protocol) - it helps network admins to manage and monitor network devices.

- [[SSH]] - (Secure Shell) - provides a secure way to connect and send commands to a  device over  an insecure network such as the internet.

- [[Telnet]] -  was designed for remote connectivity it establishes connection between remote endpoint and the host. It prompts users to login to gain access

## ***[[Transport Layer]]***

- [[TCP]] - (Transmission Control Protocol) its a connection- oriented protocol that offers reliable delivery with packet sequencing, re-transmission of lost packets and flow control. 
- [[UDP]] - (User Datagram Protocol) an alternative to TCP  that also works with IP to transmit time-sensitive data.
## ***[[Internet Layer]]***

- [[ARP]] - (Address resolution Protocol) maps IP addresses to physical MAC  addresses of devices and the other way around within a LAN so devices can communicate with one another.

-  [[ICMP]] - (Internet Control Message Protocol) a supporting protocol inn the TCP/IP model that is mainly used for network diagnostics, troubleshooting, error reporting and some limited control functions between network devices

- [[IP]] - (Internet Protocol) - functions lie postal service giving each computer a unique address within LAN. 

## ***Other specialized protocols***

- [[BGP]] - (Boarder Gateway Protocol) helps with exchange of routing data between different autonomous systems.

- [[OSPF]] - (Open Shortest Path First) a dynamic link-state routing protocol for IP networks.
