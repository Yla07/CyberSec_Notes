(Open Systems Interconnection) it is a conceptual framework that divides network functions into 7 layers.
Those layers are:
1. [[Physical Layer]] -physical transmission media .

2. [[Data link layer]] - error free transfer between adjacent nodes.

3. [[Network layer]] -  manages addressing and routing. 

4. [[Transport Layer]] - end to end data delivery and flow control,

5. [[Session Layer]] - Establishes manages and terminates connections.

6. [[Presentation Layer]] - formats and encrypts data for the application layer.

7. [[Application Layer]] - provides network services to end-user applications.
