Types of  connection:
- [[Ethernet]] - a wired connection type commonly used in LAN's (Local Area Network) provides high speed, stable and secure data transfer.

- [[WiFi]] - wireless connection  that enables devices to connect to a network without  the need of physical cables. While being convenient it is less reliable and slower than Ethernet.  

- [[Bluetooth]] - a short range wireless technology used primarily to connect to peripherals (headphones, keyboards etc.). Usually operates up to around 10 meters. It is used for personal devices rather than networks.

- [[Fiber-optic connections]] - use light signals that go trough glass or plastic fibers to transmit data at very high speeds over long distances. Ideal for connecting data centers.

- [[Cellular connections ]] - for example 4G and 5G allow mobile devices to connect  to the internet  with wireless cellular networks. They offer  a lot of mobility but the speed varies depending on network coverage.

- [[NFC]] - (Near Field Communication) a short-range  wireless technology used to exchange data over short distances up to 10 cm (4 inches).

- [[Infrared]]  -  basically utilizes light waves in the electromagnetic spectrum to send data between devices, for example remote control.
