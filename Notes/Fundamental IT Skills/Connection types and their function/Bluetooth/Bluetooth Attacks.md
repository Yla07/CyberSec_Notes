Common Bluetooth Attacks:

- **Blue-snarfing** - in this case the victims  Bluetooth software for drivers is vulnerable allowing the attacker to access  all data on the victims device. It can turn on and off the devices power or disable some features even the whole device.

- **Blue-jacking** - in this situation a Bluetooth device uses spam advertising to hijack another device. It can cause installation of malware and other undesirable data.

-  **Blue-bugging** - in  this scenario the attacker uses covert Bluetooth connection to acquire backdoor access to target device. In some circumstances, the attacker uses a DoS (Denial of Service) attack to overwhelm and disable a Bluetooth-enabled device .

- **Blue-smacking** - it is a DoS attack that aims to overwhelm target device and shut it down. During this process large data packets are sent to target device to eventually torn it off. It works as a opening for more dangerous attacks.

- **Car whispering** - used to attack automobile radios with Bluetooth functionality. It is used to listen to whats happening inside the vehicle or play some audio with malicious intent.


Bluetooth doesn't guarantee safety. Users should disable Bluetooth on their devices if they have to, refrain from sharing sensitive information via Bluetooth, and decline any unauthorized connection requests in order to reduce the potential risk of Bluetooth attacks. The Bluetooth SIG has put programs in place to address usability problems and enhance interoperability.
