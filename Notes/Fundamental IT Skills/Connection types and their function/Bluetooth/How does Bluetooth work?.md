Bluetooth works on non-ionizing electromagnetic waves in a radio frequency between  2.40 GHz and 2.48 GHz as a radio transmission system with low power and short range. 

Converting data into a format that can be transferred by Bluetooth happens by first processing the signal by a software using  a special compression mechanism known as codec.

To "pair" neighboring devices Bluetooth uses short-range radio waves.

The max range of Bluetooth devices varies on the environment and device class.  The  majority of devices use connection range of 10 meters. The range may  be different based on the electromagnetic  environment or barriers.

Integrated Bluetooth technology elements that improve its security: 
-  **Adaptive frequency** -  Bluetooth frequency hopping has the 2.4 GHz ISM band that has 79 channels and allows  for hops at a rate of 1600 hops per second. Existing freqencies are avoided. 

- **Pairing** - it gives permission  to communicate between devices. To make a pairing request  the BD_ADDR (a unique 48-bit address for every device) of the device must be known

- **Undetectibility** - Devices must be undetectable in order to respond to scanning attempts. The BD_ADDR must also be hidden

- **E0 Cipher Suite** - the cipher typically  uses stream ciphering and has a key length of 128 bits
