**Bluetooth** - is a wireless technology that allows communication between devices on short distances using ultra-high frequency radio waves with wave-length of 2.4 GHz.

Wi-Fi and Bluetooth both operate in the same limited band of frequencies, but Bluetooth consumes significantly less power, so there is very little interference with a Wi-Fi connection.

Bluetooth technology encrypts and decrypts data into packages using algorithms known as codecs to facilitate data transmission.
