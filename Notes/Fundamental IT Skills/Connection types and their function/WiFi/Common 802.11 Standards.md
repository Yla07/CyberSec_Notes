- 802.11b - It was introduced in 1999 and is the slowest and cheapest standard. It was popular for a long time but now is loosing popularity due to faster standards are getting cheeper. It transfers at a radio frequency of 2.4 GHz and can handle up to 11 megabits of data per second. 

- 802.11a - transmits at 5 GHz and can move up to 54 megabits of data per second. It uses  OFDM a more efficient coding technique that splits that radio signal into several sub-signals before they reach a receiver. It reduces interference by a lot.

- 802.11b - is faster because it uses the same OFDM coding as 802.11a.

- 802.11g - transmits at 2.4 GHz like 802.11b, but it's a lot faster. It can handle up to 54 megabits of data per second. 

- 802.11n- backward comaptible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g. Unlike the 802.11g that theoretically moves 54 megabits of data per second, it only achieves real-world speeds of about 24 megabits of data per second because of network congestion.

- 802.11ac -  operate s exclusively on 5 GHz frequency. is also backwards compatible with the previous technologies. It can run up to 450 megabits per second on a single stream although real wold speeds may be slower. it allows to eight special data streams  sometimes is called 5G because of it frequency  or Gigabit WiFi because of its potential to exceed a gigabit per second on multiple streams.

- 802.11ax - Also known as WiFi 6. It allows even higher data transfer of up to 9.2 Gbps. WiFi 6 also lets manufacturers install many more antennas on one router, accepting multiple connections at once without any worry of interference and slowdown. Some newer devices connect on a frequency of 6 GHz which is about 20 percent faster than 5 GHz frequency.

- 802.11be - known as WiFi 7 started rolling out in 2024, offering even better range, more connections and faster data rates than any of the previous versions.
