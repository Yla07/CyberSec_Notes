WiFi networks are made by having a wireless access point that devices  can connect to.

There are to types of common Wifi Networks:
- BSS (Basic Service Set) - one access point connected to back to the wired connection to which all the devices are connected.
- ESS (Extended Service Set) - Basically more than one acess point that seamlessly look like connected to the same WiFi. The acess points have a diffrent BSSID but have the  same SSID.
